# SportsVenueManagementSystem
 This system is built using C# and MySql


This project is a sports venue booking windows form application which helps you 
book among various sporting venues as per your requirements. It allows you to 
choose from multiple venues and book at the time of your convenience.
Sports are an integral part of life. Booking venues, however, could be a headache. 
To solve this problem, we plan on building a windows forms application which 
helps customers book sports venues without the hassle of making multiple calls. 
There exist lots of sporting venues in our close vicinity, but users might not be 
aware of them. 
By building this bridge to cover the gap between sport venue owners and the 
customers, we plan on making a sports venue management system. It makes it 
easier for customers to book as well as manage their bookings and to choose from 
various venues for the duration needed. It also helps sport venue owners make 
their venues more accessible and make the process simpler.
